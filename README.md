* This repo is a learning exapmle of how to gain the skills in scripts and knowledge based wikis for later resources.
* I'm learning these skills to gain a better understanding of networks and security. Along with admin tasks functions.

* The ability to automate so many of thes scripts can easily make the day of an admin alot easier. 
* I would improve my BAsh scripts and figure out functional uses in my day to day.
